### Project Title: Athkar Al Muslim

This is the title of the project. "Athkar" refers to specific phrases or prayers that Muslims recite at various times of the day.

### Project Description

The description provides an overview of what the website does:
- **Organizes Athkar**: The website categorizes different Athkar (prayers) based on the time they are supposed to be recited. This helps users easily find and recite the appropriate prayers at the right times.
- **Digital Tasbeeh Counter**: The website includes a digital counter to help users keep track of their Tasbeeh (a form of remembrance of Allah, often involving the repetition of specific phrases).
- **Prayer Times and Muslim Holidays**: The homepage includes information about daily prayer times and important Muslim holidays, providing users with essential religious timings and dates.

### Categories of Athkar

The README lists the different categories of Athkar that the website organizes:
- **Athkar Al Sabah (Morning Athkar)**: Prayers to be recited in the morning.
- **Athkar Al Masaa (Evening Athkar)**: Prayers to be recited in the evening.
- **Athkar after obligatory prayers**: Prayers to be recited after the five daily obligatory prayers.
- **Athkar before sleeping and wake up**: Prayers to be recited before sleeping and upon waking up.
