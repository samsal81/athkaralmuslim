# Project Title: Athkar Al Muslim

This is the title of the project. "Athkar" refers to specific phrases or prayers that Muslims recite at various times of the day. 

## Importance of Athkar

Athkar hold significant importance in the daily lives of Muslims. They serve as a means of remembering Allah, seeking His blessings, and finding peace and tranquility. Reciting Athkar regularly helps in:
- Strengthening faith and connection with Allah.
- Providing spiritual comfort and reducing stress.
- Seeking protection from harm and evil.
- Expressing gratitude and seeking forgiveness.
- Enhancing mindfulness and focus during daily activities.

By organizing and categorizing these prayers, the website aims to make it easier for users to incorporate Athkar into their daily routines.
